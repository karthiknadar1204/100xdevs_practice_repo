When a Request is Made:

// The rate limiter checks the IP address of the incoming request.
// It tracks how many requests have been made by this IP address within the configured time window.
// If the Limit is Not Exceeded:

// The request is allowed to proceed, and the rate limiter updates the count for the IP address.
// If the Limit is Exceeded:

// The request is blocked.
// The server responds with a message indicating that the rate limit has been
// exceeded and tells the user to wait before making more requests.


// otpLimiter: Limits how many OTP requests an IP address can make in a 5-minute window (up to 3 requests).
// Rate limiting controls how many times a user or IP address can access a particular resource (like an API endpoint)
//  within a specific time period. It helps prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
