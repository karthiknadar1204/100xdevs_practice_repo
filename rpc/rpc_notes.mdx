What is RPC
RPC stands for remote procedure call . As the name suggests, it lets you call a function in on a different process/server/backend and get back
a response from it.


why RPC?
This is how we’ve made our backends talk to each other until now.
We send out an http request , get back a response.

here are a few flaws in this approach
No types. You don’t know what is the shape of the data you will get back. You might be able to share types between 2 Node.js backends somehow,
but if the other backend is in Rust, then you cant get back the types from it.

We use JSON to serialize and deserialize data
We have to know what axios is , or what fetch is . We need to understand HTTP and how to call it
Not language agnostic at all. We have to use a different library in Java, go, rust to send an http request to the server




GRPC
gRPC is an open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It allows you to define services and messages using
Protocol Buffers, a language-agnostic data serialization format, and then generate client and server code in various programming languages
 
TRPC
tRPC gives u types on the frontend and backend if u have a full stack app in js.
We have a video from cohort 1 on it. Not used too much




PROTOCOL BUFFERS(protobuf)
Protocol buffers are Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, JSON.
The protocol buffers are where we define our service definitions and messages. This will be like a contract or common interface between the client and
server on what to expect from each other; the methods, types, and returns of what each operation would bear.

Schema Definition Language: Protocol Buffers use a schema definition language (.proto files) to define the structure of data. This language allows you
to specify message types, fields, enums, and services.

Binary Serialization: Protocol Buffers serialize data into a binary format, which is more compact and efficient compared to text-based formats like XML and JSON. 
Language Support and Code Generation: Protocol Buffers support code generation for a wide range of programming languages, including C++, Java, Go, Python,
JavaScript, Ruby, and more. Protocol Buffers come with tools (e.g., protoc) that generate code in various programming languages based on your .proto files.
 


 Sample proto file:
 syntax = "proto3";

// Define a message type representing a person.
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
}

service PersonService {
  // Add a person to the address book.
  rpc AddPerson(Person) returns (Person);-->can be thought of as an http endpoint.
  
  // Get a person from their name
  rpc GetPersonByName(GetPersonByNameRequest) returns (Person);-->can be thought of as an http endpoint.
}

message GetPersonByNameRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

There are a few things to unpack here - 
message - A message that can be encoded/decoded/transferred 
types
string
int32
service - Describes what all rpc methods you support


Field numbers
In Protocol Buffers, each field within a message type is assigned a unique numerical identifier called a tag or field number. These field numbers serve
several purposes:

Efficient Encoding: Field numbers are used during serialization and deserialization to efficiently encode and decode the data. Instead of including field
names in the serialized data, Protocol Buffers use field numbers, which are typically more compact and faster to process.

Backward Compatibility: Field numbers are stable identifiers that remain consistent even if you add, remove, or reorder fields within a message type. This
means that old serialized data can still be decoded correctly by newer versions of your software, even if the message type has changed.

Language Independence: Field numbers provide a language-independent way to refer to fields within a message type. Regardless of the programming language 
used to generate the code, the field numbers remain the same, ensuring interoperability between different implementations.








Types in pbf
Protobuffs give you access to a lot of types/enums/message types
 
 1) Scalar Types:
int32, int64, uint32, uint64: Signed and unsigned integers of various sizes.
float, double: Floating-point numbers.
bool: Boolean values (true or false).
string: Unicode text strings.
bytes: Arbitrary binary data.
eg:
syntax = "proto3";

// Define a message type representing an address.
message Address {
  string street = 1;
  string city = 2;
  string state = 3;
  string zip = 4;
}

// Define a message type representing a person.
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
  Address address = 3;
}


2) Message Types:
Message types allow you to define structured data with nested fields. They can contain scalar types, other message types, or repeated fields (arrays).
You define message types using the message keyword followed by the name of the message type and its fields.
eg:
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
  repeated string phone_numbers = 3;
}


3) Enum Types:
Enum Types:
Enum types define a set of named constant values.
You define enum types using the enum keyword followed by the name of the enum type and its values.
eg:
enum PhoneType {
  MOBILE = 0;
  HOME = 1;
  WORK = 2;
}


4) Maps
Maps are a collection of key-value pairs.
message MapMessage {
  map<string, int32> id_to_age = 1;
}


A more complex example:
syntax = "proto3";

// Define an enum representing the type of phone numbers.
enum PhoneType {
  MOBILE = 0;
  HOME = 1;
  WORK = 2;
}

// Define a message type representing a phone number.
message PhoneNumber {
  string number = 1;
  PhoneType type = 2;
}

// Define a message type representing an address.
message Address {
  string street = 1;
  string city = 2;
  string state = 3;
  string zip = 4;
}

// Define a message type representing a person.
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
  repeated PhoneNumber phone_numbers = 3;
  Address address = 4;
}
